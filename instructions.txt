Social Media Content Optimizer (Chrome Extension)
Uses Rewriter API + Writer API + Prompt API. Helps users optimize their social media posts for different platforms by adjusting tone, length, and hashtags while maintaining authenticity. Addresses social media engagement challenges.


Accessibility Text Simplifier (Web Application)
Uses Rewriter API + Summarizer API. Converts complex web content into plain language for users with cognitive disabilities, non-native speakers, or children. Promotes web accessibility and inclusion.

Scenario: An autistic user on a social media site struggles with slang and flashing ads.
Solution: The extension simplifies posts (e.g., “LOL, great pic!” becomes “I like your photo”), disables animations, and reads comments aloud with clear navigation (“next post”).

Real-Time Emotional Tone Guidance:

Challenge: Difficulty interpreting emotional tones in posts or comments (e.g., sarcasm in “Wow, nice job”).
Solution: Prompt API labels posts with emotional context (e.g., “This comment is sarcastic”) and suggests appropriate reactions (e.g., “Avoid responding to negative tones”).

Implementation: Prompt API processes text for sentiment; Proofreader API ensures clear labels.

Benefit: Helps users navigate social nuances, reducing miscommunication.

## **The Universal Web Access Pitch**

Right now, $1$ billion people worldwide struggle to fully access the internet—from a dyslexic student battling academic jargon to a blind user encountering images without descriptions.

Our **Chrome extension** instantly transforms any webpage into accessible content. Using on-device AI like **Gemini Nano**, a single click simplifies complex medical articles, adds audio descriptions and narration, provides visual formatting for deaf users, and translates content for non-native speakers.

We're not just making websites prettier; we're **making the entire internet inclusive**. Unlike others who build for the majority, we are unlocking digital access for everyone who’s been left behind, all while ensuring **complete privacy** by processing everything locally on your device.

This is **universal design**, not just assistive technology. We are transforming how $1$ billion people experience the web. One extension, any website, total accessibility.
